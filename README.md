## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to my **LeetCode DSA Journey** — a well-structured and consistently growing collection of my solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/adarsh65/).

This repository serves as both:
- A **learning log** to track my daily/weekly problem-solving progress.
- A **public archive** of clean, optimized, and beginner-friendly C++ solutions.

Whether you're a fellow learner or a recruiter, feel free to explore!

Readable, optimized, and logically structured solutions using modern C++ syntax.

📝 **Daily/Weekly Commits**  
Active participation — pushing new problems frequently as part of my DSA routine.

🌐 **Linked to LeetCode**  
Each solution links back to the respective LeetCode problem for easy reference.

## 💪 My Mission

> “Getting stronger one problem at a time.”

I'm mastering DSA to build a solid foundation for **AI, Machine Learning**, and **competitive programming**, and to excel in **tech interviews** and **core development** roles.
